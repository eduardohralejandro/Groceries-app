## Groceries app
 :tada: 

 Groceries app is an application which allows users from companies to do their shopping list for their next event.

You can run this project with 

### `npm start`

### `Features`

### `Home/component: main component`

- Add title to the shopping list 
- You can add items to the shopping list.
- Delete items while creating a list.
- Save shopping list (thinking in a database)
- You can not save if all the information required is not completed(e.g you could not 
save in the database if the text input is empty).
- Display list in a organised way.
- Delete an entire list.
- Mark as bought (item).
- When checked item as bought you must add name and price and you can not save in the "database" 
if is empty.
- There are always unique IDs for every item created.
- UX desicions: auto focus in some of the inputs for better experience.

### `Recipes component`

- Select dropdown.
- Select recipes from API based in the ingredients on the list of the company.

### `Expenses`

- In this tab will be displayed the amount.
of the total money spent of all the employees every month of the year.

### `Improvementes/features for next versions`
 
- A better css stucture, improve UI/mobile versions.
- We can edit an item + delete item after being saved - (login system: these actions can only be done by an admin)
- Build search bar.
- Save recipes.
- Logs.
- Clear inputs.

I think to continue the next weeks developing these features / Nodejs, mongodb and jwt as principal tools.



### `Proud of & reviewing`

I was curious about graphs(D3js) and React.js so for the first time I built a feature combining these two technologies(expenses component), when I saw the bar from my graph taking my props and going up was awesone.

But I think you can check more ListsLayouts/Items/Additems and maybe recipes but the first three are the main part of the application, it was a great experience.
